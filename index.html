<!-- In this project, I applied several debugging techniques from browser development tools. 
 I used console.log to track form submission steps and error handling. This helped me ensure
  that form values were being captured correctly, and that the right output was displayed based 
  on conditions. Using the browser's JavaScript console, I was able to spot incorrect values
   and follow the code execution flow, especially within the try-catch block. This allowed me
    to capture and handle any exceptions without breaking the form submission.

In addition, I explored Breakpoints in the DevTools, which allowed me to pause the code execution
 at specific lines and inspect the value of variables step-by-step. I also used Network tab to
  make sure that no unnecessary network calls were being made during form submission. -->
