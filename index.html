        <h1>Alexa Wenger</h1>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I am from Lancaster, PA, currently pursuing a double major in CS: Software Engineering and CS: Data Science, with a Minor in Mathematics at Liberty University. I am in my junior year and will graduate 2026.</p>

        <h4>Fun Facts:</h4>
        <!-- list of interesting facts -->
        <ul>
            <li>I ran track here at LU my freshman year. I was an 800 specialist.</li>
            <li>I have two brothers. My older brother graduated from Pitt and works at JPMorgan. My younger brother is a freshman accounting major here at LU.</li>
            <li>I love the color green - you'll definitely see this in my work!</li>
            <li>I love to travel and I've been to 13 countries</li>
            <li>Baking for people is my love language. I like to cook too!</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Biblical Worldview:</h4>
        <p>Front end design aims to make information beautiful. This makes people's lives easier. Christians have a responsibility to work hard and reflect Christ in all that we do. Colossians 3:23-24 says "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving." This verse can encourage us as developers to create beauty and proclaim truth in all that we do, even web development.</p>
